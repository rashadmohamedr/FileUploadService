# TODO: Add python-magic for file type detection
# - Reads "magic numbers" (file signatures) to detect real file type
# - Prevents attacks where malware.exe is renamed to photo.jpg
# - On Windows, you need both packages:
python-magic
python-magic-bin

# TODO: OPTIONAL - Add clamd for virus scanning
# - Requires ClamAV to be installed on your system
# - See app/core/validators.py for setup instructions
# - Comment out if you don't want virus scanning
# clamd
