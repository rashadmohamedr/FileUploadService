# File Upload Service 📁

A production-ready RESTful API built with FastAPI for secure file upload, management, and user authentication. This service provides a complete backend solution for handling file storage with user management capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication**
  - User registration with email validation
  - Secure login system
  - Password hashing using bcrypt
  - JWT token-based authentication with access tokens
  - Protected endpoints with user authentication

- **File Management**
  - Upload files with automatic UUID-based naming
  - Download files by ID with ownership verification
  - List user's own files
  - Delete files with ownership checks (removes from both disk and database)
  - Content type detection and preservation
  - File ownership tracking and authorization

- **Security**
  - JWT token authentication and authorization
  - Password hashing with bcrypt
  - SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy ORM
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Secure file path handling
  - User ownership verification for all file operations

- **Database**
  - SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite (easily switchable to PostgreSQL/MySQL)
  - Automatic database initialization
  - Relational data model with proper foreign keys (Users ↔ Files)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Database**: SQLAlchemy (SQLite default, PostgreSQL recommended for production)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with Passlib/bcrypt
- **Validation**: Pydantic v2
- **Server**: Uvicorn
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **File Processing**: Pillow, python-magic (optional)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- pip

## 🔧 Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd FileUploadService
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./files.db
   UPLOAD_DIR=uploads/
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here-change-in-production

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **JWT Authentication**: All file operations require valid JWT tokens
- **Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- **File Ownership**: Users can only access/modify their own files
- **File Storage**: Files are saved with UUID-based names to prevent path traversal attacks
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration is stored in `.env` file (not committed to git)
- **SQL Injection Protection**: SQLAlchemy ORM prevents SQL injection
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic validates all input data

## 🚧 Roadmap

### ✅ Completed Features (`main`)
- User registration and authentication
- JWT token generation and validation

#### New Major Features

- **Analytics Dashboard API** (`feature/analytics-dashboard`)

  1. **Data Collection**:
    - Tracks events like file uploads and downloads. [`Done`]
    - Logs user activity, such as login times and actions performed. [`Done`]

  2. **Data Aggregation**:
    - Aggregates data to show:
      - Total files and Storage usage uploaded per user. [`Done`]
      - Storage usage trends over time. [`Done(kind of)`]

  3. **Data Serving**:
    - Provides APIs to retrieve:
      - Daily/weekly/monthly upload statistics. [`Done`]
      - Top users of storage usage. [`Done`]
      - File types consuming the most storage.  [`Done`]

  4. **Caching**:
    - Frequently requested stats (e.g., total storage usage) are cached for quick access.

  5. **For Users**: A user can view their personal activity, such as the number of files uploaded or shared in the past month. [`Done`]

  6. **For Admins**: An admin can monitor, identify inactive users, and optimize storage usage. [`Done`]


- **API Gateway** (`feature/api-gateway`)
  - Combine multiple microservices (auth, payments, file logic)
  - Implement rate limiting
  - API key management for external clients
  1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Add `slowapi` for rate limiting:

  2. **Rate Limiting**:
    - Create `app/core/limiter.py` to configure `slowapi`.
    - Register `SlowAPIMiddleware` and exception handlers in `main.py`.
    - Apply rate limits globally and per endpoint.

  3. **API Key Management**:
    - Create `ApiKey` model in `app/models/api_key.py`.
    - Add Pydantic schemas in `app/schemas/api_key.py`.
    - Implement API key generation and validation logic in `app/services/api_key_service.py`.
    - Add endpoints for managing API keys in `app/routers/api_key_router.py`.

  4. **Centralized Routing**:
    - Refactor `main.py` to include versioned routers:
      - `/api/v1/auth`
      - `/api/v1/files`
      - `/api/v1/keys`
    - Add a health check endpoint.

  5. **Security Enhancements**:
    - Add a dependency to validate API keys in `app/dependencies.py`.
    - Ensure API keys are hashed in the database and only shown once upon creation.

  6. **Database Migration**:
    - Generate and apply Alembic migrations for the `ApiKey` model.
